# solution from leetcode

# Idea: Find the first index violating the ascending order, and the first index violating the descending order from the end. 
# Our temporary window â†’ [start, end]
# But sorting the window alone does not guarantee sorting the whole array. 
# We also need to extend to numbers before the window which are bigger than the minimum of window, 
# and extend to numbers after the window which are smaller than the maximum of the window.

def findUnsortedSubarray(nums):
	n = len(nums)
	start = 0
	end = n - 1
	
	# find first index violating ascending order
	while start < n - 1 and nums[start] <= nums[start+1]:
		start += 1

	# edge case: already sorted
	if start == n - 1:
		return 0
	
	# find first index violating descending order in reverse
	while end > 0 and nums[end] >= nums[end-1]:
		end -= 1
	
	# find min and max of our temporary window
	windowMax = max(nums[start:end+1])
	windowMin = min(nums[start:end+1])

	# extend the window
	while start > 0 and nums[start-1] > windowMin:
		start -= 1
            
	while end < n -1 and nums[end+1] < windowMax:
		end += 1

	return end - start + 1
